# FER + GAN

This file is for our Mentia Data Discovery spring 2022. 

We first aged the data using this pretrained model. We forked this Repo: https://github.com/HasnainRaz/Fast-AgingGAN

**The data is not included in this file, because the file size was too large for Github.** 

The code to call the GANs model is featured in the **"data_processor.py"** file. This contains the custom functions we built in order to iteratively call the GANS model. 

The models we wrote are in the **"models.py"** file. 

The deployment/demo with a webcam or a given video is in the **"demo.py"** file.
